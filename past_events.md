**Past Events Conducted by Mukti**

At Mukti, we believe in creating a vibrant space where learning meets fun, and technology is explored with curiosity and enthusiasm. 
Over the years, we’ve organized a variety of events that blend hands-on learning with exciting challenges, allowing students to dive deep 
into the world of Free and Open Source Software (FOSS), cybersecurity, hardware, and beyond. Here’s a look at some of our past events that 
sparked innovation, creativity, and endless possibilities.

### Tantra Yantra – A Hardware Playground with Raspberry Pi, Pico, and Arduino

**Tantra Yantra** was where hardware met imagination! In this fun-filled workshop, students got their hands dirty (in the best way possible)
with **Raspberry Pi**, **Raspberry Pi Pico**, and **Arduino**. The session was all about playing with circuits, building cool gadgets, and 
understanding the magic behind embedded systems. Whether it was creating IoT devices, controlling motors, or simply flashing LEDs in all the 
colors of the rainbow, Tantra Yantra allowed participants to see how software and hardware can come together to create something truly exciting. 
It was more than a workshop—it was an adventure into the world of electronics, with plenty of room for experimentation and discovery.

### Galti-Se-Mistake – Git, but in the Best Way Possible

**Galti-Se-Mistake** was an interactive, “oops, I did it again” kind of workshop where we embraced the beauty of **Git** 
and version control. In this hands-on session, students learned to avoid common mistakes (and embraced them when they happened) 
while mastering the essentials of Git. From creating repositories and branching to resolving merge conflicts and managing pull requests, 
the workshop was packed with practical skills to help students manage code like pros. By the end of the session, everyone was a Git ninja, 
ready to collaborate on projects without fear of messing up—because, in Git, mistakes are just another opportunity to learn!



### Satark 2.5 – Cybersecurity with a Side of Hands-On Demos

**Satark**, our flagship **cybersecurity seminar**, is where the real magic happens! Think of it as a blend of eye-opening talks, hands-on demos, and a whole lot of “wow” moments. This event focuses on raising awareness about cybersecurity while getting down to the nitty-gritty of ethical hacking. We bring in experts, show live demos of penetration testing, vulnerability scanning, and real-time exploits, and get everyone involved in making systems more secure. Whether it was cracking open a network, finding vulnerabilities, or learning how to defend against attacks, Satark was all about pushing the limits of security knowledge in the most engaging way possible. It’s the cybersecurity event you didn’t know you needed—and we’re proud of every byte of it!

Establishing a Think Tank for Academia

One of Mukti’s most exciting and impactful efforts is our initiative to elevate the academic landscape in India. 
We’ve established a think tank that focuses on producing high-quality research with the aim of presenting it at international conferences. 
The Mukti think tank brings together the brightest minds from our community to collaborate on cutting-edge research projects in fields like cybersecurity, 
embedded systems, and open-source development. By focusing on producing rigorous, innovative research, we aim to put Indian academia on the global map. Our team of 
students and faculty is dedicated to pushing the boundaries of knowledge, and our research has already been presented at prestigious international events, furthering 
Mukti’s mission to enhance India’s academic standing in the global tech community.

### Other Notable Events

But wait, there’s more! Mukti’s calendar is always packed with awesome events that stir up creativity and knowledge. Here are some of the other exciting sessions we've hosted:

1. **Open-Source Contributor Program** – This initiative gave students a gateway to the world of open-source contributions. We guided participants through the process of contributing to global repositories, from fixing bugs to adding features, and they got to leave their mark on the open-source world. Plus, they earned plenty of kudos along the way!

2. **FOSS Meetups and Collaboration Sessions** – When like-minded techies gather, magic happens! These meetups were all about sharing ideas, collaborating on projects, and networking with the broader open-source community. It’s where students could show off their personal projects, discuss the future of FOSS, and even team up for new and exciting initiatives.

3. **Hackathons and CTF Competitions** – Who doesn’t love a good challenge? Our **Capture the Flag (CTF)** competitions were full of thrilling hacking puzzles, cryptography challenges, and reverse engineering tests. Whether it was breaking into a simulated network or decrypting secret messages, these events kept everyone on their toes, learning through fun and competitive gameplay.

4. **Secure Coding Workshops** – At Mukti, we believe coding should be safe and sound! Our **secure coding workshops** taught students how to write code that not only works but is also resilient to vulnerabilities. Through hands-on examples and live demos, participants learned how to safeguard their code against common threats like SQL injection, buffer overflows, and XSS attacks.

5. **Tech Talks and Panel Discussions** – We hosted a variety of **tech talks** and **panel discussions** featuring industry professionals who shared insights on everything from **cybersecurity** and **AI** to **blockchain** and **cloud computing**. These sessions were like a backstage pass to the future of technology, offering valuable tips and thought-provoking discussions.

6. **Collaboration with Industry and Academic Institutions** – At Mukti, we’re all about building bridges, and that’s exactly what we did with leading academic institutions and top tech companies. By collaborating with places like the **Indian Institute of Science (IISc)** and the **Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs)**, we gave students access to world-class resources, mentorship, and internships. It’s these connections that help our community continue to grow and thrive.

Through every event, Mukti has remained a place where students come to explore, learn, and have fun with technology. From hardware tinkering to code cracking, we create opportunities for hands-on experiences, collaboration, and innovation. And as we continue to grow, one thing remains certain—Mukti is all about learning, evolving, and having a blast while doing it!
